--

These are drop-in pages (and libraries) for Flamework so that all auth and login
magic is handled using the Twitter API as a single sign-on provider.

It works but has not been documented yet. Start with [bin/setup.sh](https://github.com/straup/flamework-twitterapp/blob/master/bin/setup.sh)

To do
--

* Add code to allow basic Twitter OAuth-fu without also creating a new database user.
